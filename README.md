# C-lists =: some classes 

This repository have a few codes made in ANSI C with implementation of lists subclass:
  * `queue`
  * `stack`
  * `deque`

The implementation was divided in "static" and "dynamic"; the static implementation uses just vectors and dynamic use linkeds lists.

## Usage

Clone this repository and after it, open a terminal session on the working directory, use make and execute the program you wish:
  
  * `cd static || cd dynamic`
  * `make`
  * `./type-program.out`

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D

## History

For now, after hours, I have finally implemented a basic control system for a "half-dynamic" queue.
