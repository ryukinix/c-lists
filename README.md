# C-lists =: some classes 

This repository count a few codes made in ANSI C with implementation of lists subclass:
  * `queue`
  * `stack`
  * `deque`

The implementation was divised in "static" and "dynamic"; the static implementation uses just vectors and dynamic use linkeds lists.

## Usage

Clone this repository and after open a terminal session on the working directory that compile with gcc and execute.:
  * `gcc file.c -o file.out && ./file.out`

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D

## History

For now, after hours, I finally i did can implement a basic control system for a "half-dynamic" queue.

## Roadmap
  - [ ] make a system control type and your fundamental methods for the three lists types:
    - [ ] queue
      - [X] static
        - [X] insert
        - [X] delete
        - [X] search
        - [X] edit
      - [ ] dynamic
        - [ ] insert
        - [ ] delete
        - [ ] search
        - [ ] edit
    - [ ] stack
      - [ ] static
        - [X] insert
        - [X] delete
        - [X] search
        - [X] edit
      - [ ] dynamic
        - [ ] insert
        - [ ] delete
        - [ ] search
        - [ ] edit
    - [ ] deque
      - [ ] static
        - [X] insert
        - [X] delete
        - [X] search
        - [X] edit
      - [ ] dynamic
        - [ ] insert
        - [ ] delete
        - [ ] search
        - [ ] edit
