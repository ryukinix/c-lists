# C-lists =: some classes 

This repository have a few codes made in ANSI C with implementation of lists subclass:
  * `queue`
  * `stack`
  * `deque`

The implementation was divided in "static" and "dynamic"; the static implementation uses just vectors and dynamic use linkeds lists.

## Usage

Clone this repository and after it, open a terminal session on the working directory, use make and execute the program you wish:
  
  * `cd static || cd dynamic`
  * `make`
  * `./type-program.out`

## History

Race, life’s a race
And **I’m gonna win**
Yes, **I’m gonna win**
I’ll light the fuse and **I’ll never lose**

And I choose to survive, whatever it takes
You won’t pull ahead
I’ll keep up the pace
I’ll reveal my strength to the whole human race

Yes, I am prepared to stay alive
And I won’t forgive, vengeance is mine
And **I won’t give in, because I choose to thrive**
Yes, **I'm gonna win**.

Race, it’s a race
And **I’m gonna win**
Yes, **I’m gonna win**
I’ll light the fuse and **I’ll never lose**

And I choose to survive, whatever it takes
You won’t pull ahead ’cause I’ll keep up the pace
I’ll reveal my strength to the whole human race
Yes, I'm gonna win.
